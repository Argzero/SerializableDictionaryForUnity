# Serializable Dictionary For Unity
A Dictionary that can be serialized in the Unity Inspector. Instructions for how to get your dictionary to display are in the Serialized Dictionary Class. Enjoy.

Thanks to Vexe on the Unity forums for the original SerializableDictionary class and starting portions of the inspector visualization. Content has been added for automatic iteration in creation of keys in the inspector for custom enums and other types.
